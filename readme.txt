Standout Content adds an option to mark a post as standout for Google News.

== Description ==

This plugin adds an option to mark a post as standout for Google News, the new link tag introduced on September 24, 2011 by Google. You can check or uncheck the option for each post. 

You souldn't mark too many posts as standout (or your tags get less recognized by Google). To help you with that, this plugin shows you each post tagged within the last 7 days.

This plugin was developed for our <a href="http://www.gameplorer.de">Casual Games Blog</a>. I hope it will help you too.
